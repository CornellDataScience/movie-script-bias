DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - DAY                                      1\n\"HEAD OVER HEELS\" by the Go-Go's plays as we wind through a\nflock of abstract, silky, golden strands -- PULLING BACK, to\ndiscover that the strands are hair on a BLONDE GIRL's head.\nBut not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma, the\nblondest, most beautiful sorority at USC.\nWe PULL BACK further to see that she's signing a handmade\ncard. She holds it up ~ OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts\nand glitter surrounding and \"Good Luck Tonight!\" and \"Elle\nand Warner forever!.\"\nShe carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across\nthe hall, into the room of --\nTHREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom\nroutine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card\nGirl out and into the room of --\nA BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a\nStairmaster as \"General Hospital\" plays on a tiny TV. She\nsigns the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to\nthe room of--\nA BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long\nenough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her\nneck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of --\nA BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a\nglass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE\nGIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being\nsigned, as the drinks go the other.\nOnce the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we\nfollow her out of the room and down the hall until she\nreaches the very last and biggest door --\nShe puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides\nthe card under the door.\nINT. ELLE'S DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                   2\nThe CARD slides into the pink room, hitting the feet of\nUNDERDOG, a tiny chihuahua ~ who picks it up in his mouth\nand trots it over to a pair of perfectly pedicured feet in\nstrappy sandals.\nAn equally perfectly manicured hand with a \"Sisters Forever\"\ncharm bracelet dangling from the wrist, scoops up Underdog.\n(CONTINUED)\n2.\n2                                                                  2\nAs he rises, we RISE WITH HIM, passing toned, waxed, tanned\nlegs in pink Prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs\nencased in a spaghetti-strap top -- until we finally reveal a\nmagnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet, beautiful\nface. This is ELLE WOODS, 21, the Goddess Queen of Delta\nGamma. She talks on a pink, fuzzy phone.\nELLE\n(into the phone)\nI love you, too!\nBehind her, a \"Go USC\" banner is pinned to the pink wall. A\nstack of \"Cosmopolitan\"s and \"Glamour\"s teeters on the\ndresser. The closet overflows with trendy, designer clothes\nin a predominance of pink.\nELLE (CONT'D)\n(continuing; into phone)\nI'll see you tonight.\nShe hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy, kissing Underdog's\nhead and taking the card out of his mouth. She reads it,\ntouched.\nELLE (CONT'D)\n(continuing)\n\"Elle and Warner forever\". Aww...\nUnderdog yips.\n2\n3   INT. DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - SAME TIME\nA Delta Gamma/Sigma Chi barbecue in full swing. Beautiful\ncollege students drink beer and mingle, trying to figure out\nwho they're going to sleep with next.\nThe main wall of the living room has been designated as a\n\"Model Wall\" of Delta Gamma girls -- ELLE smiles at us from a\nHawaiian Tropic ad and a Miss June USC calendar photo. A\ncover of an Italian Vogue shows a blonde sexpot MARGOT; a USC\ncheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde SERENA\nin a pom-pom pose.\nSerena walks up, fending off an admirer.\nSERENA\nJeremy, enough! I am not going to formal\nwith you.\nJeremy slinks off as Margot arrives, agitated.\nMARGOT\nCan someone please tell Rick that he is\nnot the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?\n(CONTINUED)\n3.\n3\nELLE (O.S.)\nYou guys are so sweet!\nELLE, a vision of fluffy blondeness, runs down the stairs\ntoward Serena and Margot, holding the card.\nELLE (CONT'D)\nBut I ' m not positive it's gonna happen\nto n i g h t --\n. SERENA\nHelloo...he just had lunch with his\ngrandmother. You know he got \"The Rock\".\nMARGOT\nWhy else would she have flown in from\nNewport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a\nsix carat diamond.\nELLE\n(excited)\nYou think?\nSERENA\nI can't believe you're getting engaged!\nThe three girls jump up and down, squealing and hugging.\nELLE\nC'mon \u00b7-- you have to help me pick out the\nperfect outfit.\nAs they head toward the door, Elle spots AMY, a shy girl in a\nDelta Gamma Pledge sweatshirt, standing alone.\nELLE (CONT'D)\n(continuing)\nAmy, what's wrong?\nAMY\nI don't really -- know anyone.\nELLE\n(teasing)\nThat's because you spend too much time in\nthe library. Come with me.\n(to Serena and Margot)\nI'll meet you outside.\nAs they go, Elle leads Amy over to a group of jovial Sigma\nChi brothers.\n(CONTINUED)\n4.\n( 2 )                                                        3\nELLE (CONT'D)\n(continuing)\nBra ndon , Jason, Grant --this is Amy.\nWhy don't you tell her about the time you\nguys went golfing naked?\nElle winks at Amy and.heads off as the guys launch into their\nstory.\nBRANDON\nIt was classic.
