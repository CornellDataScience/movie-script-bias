EXT. SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS -- DUSK
   ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a
   frozen lake. They SING.

                   "The Frozen Heart (Ice Worker's Song)"

                            ICE HARVESTERS
                  BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR
                  AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING,
                  THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
                  HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.

   The men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.
                  STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

                  SEE THE BEAUTY SHARP AND SHEER.
                  SPLIT THE ICE APART!
                  AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.
                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,
   share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.

                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the
   water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!
                  ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.

   A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They
   fight it back.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  STRONGER THAN ONE, STRONGER THAN TEN
                  STRONGER THAN A HUNDRED MEN!

   Massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows.

   The sun sets. Lanterns are lit.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
                  HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.
                  CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.

   In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single
   block of ice out of the water.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.
                  THERE'S BEAUTY AND THERE'S DANGER HERE.
                  SPLIT THE ICE APART!
                  BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART.

   The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it
   pulls away.

   Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a
   dinky little sled then head off.

   We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the
   sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the
   snowline...and descend upon...
