EXT. SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS -- DUSK

   ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a
   frozen lake. They SING.

                   "The Frozen Heart (Ice Worker's Song)"

                            ICE HARVESTERS
                  BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR
                  AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING,
                  THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
                  HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.

   The men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.
                  STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

                  SEE THE BEAUTY SHARP AND SHEER.
                  SPLIT THE ICE APART!
                  AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.
                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN,
   share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

   Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the
   water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!
                  ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.

   A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They
   fight it back.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  STRONGER THAN ONE, STRONGER THAN TEN
                  STRONGER THAN A HUNDRED MEN!

   Massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows.

   The sun sets. Lanterns are lit.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
                  HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.
                  CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR.

   In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single
   block of ice out of the water.

                            ICE HARVESTERS (CONT'D)
                  STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.
                  THERE'S BEAUTY AND THERE'S DANGER HERE.
                  SPLIT THE ICE APART!
                  BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART.

   The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it
   pulls away.

   Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a
   dinky little sled then head off.

   We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the
   sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the
   snowline...and descend upon...


   EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.


   INT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT

   ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops
   up beside her.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.

   Elsa doesn't stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                      (grumbling)
                  Anna, go back to sleep.

   Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (drama queen-ish)
                  I just can't. The sky's awake, so
                  I'm awake, so we have to play.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  ...Go play by yourself.

   Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.

   Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets
   an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's
   eyelids.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (mischievously)
                  Do you want to build a snowman?

   Elsa's eyes both pop open. She smiles.


   INT. CASTLE STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

   Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Come on, come on, come on, come on.

   Elsa tries to shush her, but Anna's too excited.


   INT. BALLROOM -- NIGHT

   The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  Do the magic! Do the magic!

   Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly
   burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.
   Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out
   and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching
   flakes in her palms and mouth.

                            YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  This is amazing!

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  Watch this!

   Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice
   suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna
   slides off, laughing.

   PLAY MONTAGE:

   -Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman
   together. Elsa moves his stick arms around.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                      (goofy voice)
                  Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

   Anna jumps up and hugs him.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                  I love you, Olaf.

   -Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually
   propelling them across the ice floor with her magic.

   -The girls slide down snowbanks together!

   -Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air.

                              YOUNG ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Catch me!

   Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna.

                              YOUNG ELSA
                  Gotcha!

   Anna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic.

                            YOUNG ANNA
                      (jumping faster)
                  Again! Again!

                             YOUNG ELSA
                      (struggling to keep up)
                  Slow down!

   Elsa suddenly slips.

   Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles
   down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.

                              YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                  ANNA!

   Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of
   Anna's hair, where struck, turns white.

                            YOUNG ELSA (CONT'D)
                  MAMA! PAPA!

   The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes.
                                                                     5

   The parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight
   of the room.

                            KING
                  Elsa, what have you done? This is
                  getting out of hand!

                            QUEEN
                      (seeing Anna)
                  Anna!

   The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms.

                            ELSA
                  It was an accident. I'm sorry,
                  Anna.

                            QUEEN
                      (about Anna)
                  She's ice cold.

                            KING
                  ...I know where we have to go.

                                                      SLAM CUT TO:


   INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT

   The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book
   inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles
   to a page with an ancient map.


   EXT. ARENDELLE -- NIGHT

   Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out
   of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsa's hands, leaving a
   trail of ice behind them.
