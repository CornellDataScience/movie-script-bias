INT. CHURCH CHAPEL -- DAY     Elsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She    peeks out to the audience.     Hans waves at her from the pews. He's changed his clothes.     The crown is placed on Elsa's head. The scepter and orb are    presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them.                              BISHOP                       (a whisper)                   Your Majesty, the gloves.     Elsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves,    places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb    and scepter, then turns to the people.                              BISHOP (CONT'D)                       (formal, in Old Norse)                   Sehm hon HELL-drr IN-um HELL-gum                   AYG-num ok krund ee THES-um HELL-                   gah STAHTH, ehk teh frahm FUR-ear U-                   thear...                                                                20 FROZEN - J. Lee       The scepter and orb start to freeze over.                              BISHOP (CONT'D)                   ...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.                              CROWD                   Queen Elsa of Arendelle.     Just in time. Elsa manages to set the orb and scepter back    down on the pillow before anyone notices the ice. She picks    up her gloves and slips them on. She made it.
